# War-Card-Game

Card game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user is player 1 and the computer is player 2. Whoever draws the higher face-value card wins the round and adds the cards to their pile. If both players turn over the same card (suit is irrelevant), then "war" proceeds. "War" is  where three cards are laid face down, and the fourth card is turned over. The player with the highest fourth card (face up) takes all the cards and adds them to their pile. It is possible to "war" multiple times in a row. Once one player has all the cards, the game is over.
